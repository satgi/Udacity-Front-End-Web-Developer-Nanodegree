Your response goes here!
* What new skills have you learned?
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown, Searching on MDN

* What has been easy?
Parsing the mockup

* What has been difficult?
Finding the element on MDN, like the "sup" element: if there was no hint, it could be difficult to get the keyword

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
1. Get the keyword for search engine
2. Take a glance of the "HTML element reference" on MDN, it'll be easier to choose the right element when it came to you on mockup
